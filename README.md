## AWS IaC Project (Infra As Code)

This project was deployed using 
``` zsrc
cdk init -a app --language=typescript
```

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Prereqs
-aws-cli

-aws-cdk

-nvm [ensure correct version of node]

`Nvm install 20.11.0`

`Nvm use 20.11.0`

`nvm install-latest-npm`

-npm [installs npx since 5.0]


## CLone and Code
-clone repository

-cd into repository

-run `npm install`

if necessary, install them individually from `package.json`

`"@aws-cdk/aws-apigateway": "^1.204.0",`

`"@aws-cdk/aws-dynamodb": "^1.204.0",`

`"@aws-cdk/aws-lambda": "^1.204.0",`

in the terminal, like so
`npm i @aws-cdk/aws-apigateway`



## Using an IDE
Be sure to install the plugins for aws and aws-cli as well as sam and aws-cdk-lib

whether you are using terminal and CLI or an IDK with the AWS SDK
run locally and/or deploy to aws

### Setting the env ['dev', 'stage', 'prod']
```
    let environment = 'stage'; // Adjust this manually as needed
```
